# Exercise 1
"""
  Suppose you are programming a simple game. You need to store the position of an object in the game.
  This position consists of two variables x and y, which specify the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the object, respectively.
  How can you define and assign values ​​to these two variables?

# Exercise 2
"""
  Suppose two variables x and y are defined with values ​​5 and 10.

  a) Using an expression, swap the values ​​of these two variables.

  b) Without using auxiliary variables, raise the sum of x and y to the power of 2.
